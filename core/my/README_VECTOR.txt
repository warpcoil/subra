Release Notes
=============


my_vector: A simple C++ vector clas, a replacement for std::vector.

The class is simple and can easily be extended.

A lot of stuff is missing, but I found it interesting:

 - for novices to learn
 
 - for avoiding use of std::vector because of link problems in an application using 
   mixed libraries, especially one compiled with an old Intel compiler 
   icc 7 (for Linux), and other libs compiled with newer compilers. Icc 7 uses
   an incompatible c++ standard library implementation.
