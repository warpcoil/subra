Execute JavaScript `js_code`. The result of evaluation is stored in
the `result` variable.
The code can be either a JavaScript source or a precompiled bytecode.

Return:

 - V7_OK on success. `result` contains the result of execution.
 - V7_SYNTAX_ERROR if `js_code` in not a valid code. `result` is undefined.
 - V7_EXEC_EXCEPTION if `js_code` threw an exception. `result` stores
   an exception object.
 - V7_AST_TOO_LARGE if `js_code` contains an AST segment longer than 16 bit.
   `result` is undefined. To avoid this error, build V7 with V7_LARGE_AST.
