---

Compile JavaScript code `js_code` into the byte code and write generated
byte code into opened file stream `fp`. If `generate_binary_output` is 0,
then generated byte code is in human-readable text format. Otherwise, it is
in the binary format, suitable for execution by V7 instance.
NOTE: `fp` must be a valid, opened, writable file stream.
