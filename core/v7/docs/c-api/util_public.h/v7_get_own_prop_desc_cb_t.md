C callback, analogue of JS callback `getOwnPropertyDescriptor()`.
Callbacks of this type are used for C API only, see `m7_mk_proxy()`.

`name` is the name of the property, and the function should fill `attrs` and
`value` with the property data. Before this callback is called, `attrs` is
set to 0, and `value` is `V7_UNDEFINED`.

It should return non-zero if the property should be considered existing, or
zero otherwise.

You can inspect the property attributes with the `V7_PROP_ATTR_IS_*` macros.
