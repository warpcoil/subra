  const char *v7_get_cstring(struct v7 *v7, v7_val_t *v);
---

Returns a pointer to the string stored in `v7_val_t`.

Returns NULL if the value is not a string or if the string is not compatible
with a C string.

C compatible strings contain exactly one NUL char, in terminal position.

All strings owned by the V7 engine (see `v7_mk_string()`) are guaranteed to
be NUL terminated. Out of these, those that don't include embedded NUL chars
are guaranteed to be C compatible.
