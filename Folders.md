# Folder Layout

## core

"core" contains the core C/C++ components of the kernel along with various components to support the operation of the kernel such as libgcc etc.  Also builtin to the kernel is v7 and a C/C++ to JavaScript Abstraction Layer so JavaScript programs and drivers can access IO Ports, Memory and hardware structures.

After compilation the resulting ELF image is a kernel32.sys [and eventually kernel64.sys] which automatically gets placed into the iso folder.

## rt

"rt" contains the runtime, whilst the kernel allows abstraction/translation between the JavaScript world and machine [C/C++] world, the actual stuff that does anything is in JavaScript which is minified [eventually] and zipped into an image to load as a module.

## iso

"iso" contains the root image to create an iso9660 format boot disc, this disc [when compiled] can be booted in a virtual machine, generated by genisoimage
